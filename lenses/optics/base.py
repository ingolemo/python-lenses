    """A LensLike. Serves as the backbone of the lenses library. Acts as an
    object-oriented wrapper around a function (`LensLike.func`) that
    does all the hard work. This function is an uncurried form of the
    van Laarhoven lens and has the following type (in ML-style
    notation):

    func :: (value -> functor value), state -> functor state

    A LensLike has a kind that determines what operations are valid on
    that LensLike. Valid kinds are Equality, Isomorphism, Prism, Review,
    Lens, Traversal, Getter, Setter, Fold, and None.

    Fold

    : A Fold is an optic capable of getting, but not necessarily setting,
    multiple foci at once. You can think of a fold as kind of like an
    iterator; it allows you to view many subparts of a larger structure.

    Setter

    : A Setter is an optic that is capable of setting foci in a state
    but not necessarily getting them.

    Getter

    : A Getter is a Fold that is restricted to getting a single focus at
    a time. It can not necessarily set any foci.

    Traversal

    : A Traversal is both a Fold and a Setter. It is capable of both
    setting and getting multiple foci at once.

    Lens

    : A Lens is both a Getter and a Traversal. It is capable of getting
    and setting a single focus at a time.

    Review

    : A Review is an optic that is capable of being constructed
    from. Constructing allows you to supply a focus and get back a
    complete state. You cannot neccessarily use reviews to get or set
    any values.

    Prism

    : A Prism is both a Traversal and a Review. It is capable of getting
    and setting a single focus that may or may not exist. You can also
    use it to construct.

    Isomorphism

    : An Isomorphism is both a Lens and a Prism. They can be used to
    get, set, and construct. Isomorphisms have the property that they
    are reversable; You can take an isomorphism and flip it around
    so that getting the focus becomes setting the focus and setting
    becomes getting.

    Equality

    : An Equality is an Isomorphism. Currently unused.

    None

    : Here "None" is referring to the built-in python `None` object and
    not a custom class like the other kinds. An optic of kind None is
    an invalid optic. Optics of this kind may exist internally, but if
    you manage to create a None optic through normal means then this
    represents a bug in the library.
